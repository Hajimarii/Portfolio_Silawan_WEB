Hi! Credits to WebDevs Campus for the idea for this project that I have created.
I have also included a game that I have made which I thought was supposed to be the main project to be presented but oh well it came in handy.
Credits to freeCodeCamp for the game I have created through their tutorial as well.
Make sure to check the current place/file location of the game inside this project- in order for it properly run.
Thank you! I hope this helps.
